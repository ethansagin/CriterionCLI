# CriterionCli

Welcome to the Criterion Collection Catalog gem! This CLI program serves as search engine for essential information on films within the Criterion Collection and includes search functionality for films by title, director, year, and country.

## Installation

1) Clone the github repository by entering the following command in your terminal:
"git clone git@github.com:jpier2012/beautiful_billboard.git"

2) Change directories to the cloned directory: "cd CriterionCLI"

3) Install all required gems: "bundle install"

4) Run the CLI: "./bin/run"

## Usage

The user can navigate this program by following the instructions printed in each menu. Input of prompted keywords will allow the user to access various menus, while detailed information on entries within the Catalog can be accessed by inputting the corresponding ID number for an item (i.e. movie title, director, etc.) when prompted. To return to the previous menu, input 'menu' into the console. To exit the program, navigate back to the main menu and input 'exit'.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
